# 🎬 IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis of IMDb movie reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The goal is to automatically understand whether a movie review expresses a **positive or negative opinion**.

This is a classic yet **industry-relevant NLP problem**, widely used in recommendation systems, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.
